The targeted areas are those lacking volume. Each point is connected to the others, resulting in a better overall look. The eight points targeted are: cheek bone/structure (1 and 2), tear troughs, nasolabial fold, mouth corners, pre-jowl folds, jawline areas and lower cheeks. You can opt for 4ml, 6ml or 8m Juvaderm filler, depending on the amount of work that needs doing. As skin elasticity is lowered, our facial structure starts to transform and gravity comes into play. This can lead to premature ageing, in particular around the eyes and cheeks. The greatest signs of ageing occur because of skeletal remodelling, volume loss and re-positioning of facial fat. This procedure brings back symmetry, volume and proportion to the face. Advanced dermal fillers are used to lift the tissues and structure of the face for a younger-looking profile. The procedure works so well because it targets an overall rejuvenation of the whole face, as opposed to certain areas.</p>",Text-Image-Cards,Text,Paragraph

It’s often used to fix chips, close small gaps, smooth out uneven edges, or make teeth look longer and more symmetrical. The resin is carefully sculpted by a dentist to match your natural teeth, then hardened with a special light. It’s a completely non-invasive procedure—no drills, no needles, no pain—and the results are instant. You walk in with a smile you’re self-conscious about, and walk out with one that feels like&nbsp;you. What makes composite bonding so popular is how simple and transformative it is. Unlike veneers, which require removing part of your tooth, bonding keeps your natural teeth fully intact. And unlike whitening, which may not work on all teeth or can fade quickly, bonding covers stains, wear, and imperfections with lasting results. With proper care, it can last up to 10 years and be easily touched up. It’s not about chasing perfection—it’s about feeling like your smile finally reflects who you are.</p>",FAQs,Text,Paragraph

Composite bonding is a great choice if you're looking for a quick, affordable, and non-invasive way to improve your smile. It’s ideal for fixing minor chips, small gaps, uneven edges, or discolouration. There’s no drilling or enamel removal, and it can usually be done in one visit. It’s also reversible and easier to adjust over time. Veneers, on the other hand, are more of a long-term investment. They’re custom-made, ultra-thin porcelain shells that are bonded to your teeth for a flawless, high-end result. They last longer—often 10 to 20 years—but require removing a small layer of enamel, which is permanent. Veneers are often the choice for those wanting a full smile makeover with maximum durability and polish.

The treatment is administered using fine needles and targets areas like the crown, temples, or hairline. Results develop gradually over several sessions, typically with noticeable improvement after 2–4 treatments. Hair fillers are minimally invasive, require little downtime, and are ideal for enhancing scalp and hair health, though a professional consultation is necessary to determine suitability.<br><br></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hair fillers typically contain a combination of powerful ingredients that work together to improve scalp health and stimulate hair growth.

Apart from that, full face HIFU means lifting of cheeks and nasolabial fold, jaw and décolletage tightening, and chin definition. This treatment doesn’t involve any downtime. You will notice firming and lifting of the cheeks, chin, jaw, and neck area. Your muscles and sagging skin will be tightened and your face shape will be corrected. Your complexion will appear youthful. HIFU facelift treatment involves the delivering of ultrasound energy deep into the dermis to damage the cells. As a result, the skin’s natural healing process is initiated and collagen and elastin are stimulated. The HIFU treatment uses focused ultrasound to deliver heat energy to different depths beneath the skin's surface. This triggers natural collagen regeneration while simultaneously lifting and tightening lax skin and muscles. The energy targets SMAS tissue, fascia, and fat to lift tissues and improve facial contouring. There is no damage to the outer epidermis layer, making it very safe. The treatment is completely non-invasive with no incisions. You may experience a prickling sensation as the lower face is contoured from within. Tightening and lifting occurs as new collagen develops. With just one treatment, results can last over a year. Some may benefit from a touch-up session annually to maintain effects. This production of collagen and elastin is known to strengthen the structure of the skin that holds it. Most clients will only need to attend one session in order to see amazing results. Some people may need to go for multiple sessions to achieve ideal results. This depends on the intensity of the ageing signs. The skin takes ample time to rebuild promote new collagen stimulation, this means you can experience great results in 2 to 6 months after the HIFU treatment. Our HIFU facelift treatment uses advanced ultrasound technology to non-surgically lift and tighten the lower face including the nasolabial folds, chin, jawline and neck. HIFU stands for high-intensity focused ultrasound. The treatment sends targeted ultrasound energy below the skin to stimulate collagen production and tissue lifting. This natural tightening process lifts sagging skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles and lines. Restore definition along the jawline and achieve a V-shaped face contour. Look up to 10 years younger with this innovative ""ultrasound facelift"" with no surgery or downtime required. HIFU facelift is a great alternative to lower face or neck surgical lifts. Achieve natural-looking results without undergoing a major operation. The non-invasive treatment requires no incisions or stitches. There is minimal discomfort during treatment and no extended recovery time needed. See a refreshed, youthful appearance after your sessions. You can immediately return to normal activities with no necessary post-care. The natural effects continue to improve over several months. Results are visible on the surface of the skin as deeper tissue tightening takes place. Enjoy a more defined facial contour with tightened skin on the lower face and neck. Look your absolute best with this ""no-downtime"" ultrasound facelift. <br></p>",Text-Image-Cards,Text,Paragraph

Usually, older tattoos take fewer sessions to remove than a new tattoo. You’ll notice your tattoo fading with every session until it has disappeared. Tattoo removal treatment works by using powerful pulses of light applied precisely on the tattoo pigmentation on the skin. It breaks down the ink molecules. Your body’s immune system then naturally absorbs the ink into your body safely without damaging the surrounding tissue before expelling it. After the initial session, the tattoo will be coated in a white residue (frosting). This is produced by minute gas bubbles heading towards the skin’s surface. This is how the tattoo pigments are broken down. Your skin will then be left to restore itself over the following weeks until your next appointment. Laser tattoo removal utilizes focused beams of intense light that are selectively absorbed by tattoo pigment particles. This causes the ink granules to rapidly heat up and fragment into tiny pieces. The body's immune system can then gradually clear away these ink microparticles. With repeated sessions, increasingly more tattoo pigment is broken down and eliminated until none remains. A localized cooling method protects outer skin layers from damage during treatment. Lasers allow complete removal without harming the surrounding skin. The process removes only pigment particles, leaving the skin structure itself intact. If an old or undesirable small tattoo has you self-conscious, laser removal offers an effective erase. Our precision treatments break down and eliminate the ink, allowing you to reclaim bare, clean skin. Fading those youthful indiscretions or outdated designs restores confidence and comfort in your skin. Forget painful cover-up tattoos or daily makeup hassles. Laser removal is far less traumatic than abrasion or excision techniques. The fast, low pain treatments are convenient and require no anesthesia or downtime. Both teenagers and adults benefit from erasing old small tattoos to revitalize their image. Reveal your natural beauty again.</p>",Text-Image-Cards,Text,Paragraph

Stretch marks are commonly treated with the help of Microneedling, a minimally invasive treatment, where very fine and tiny needles are used on the skin to create micro-injuries. These micro-punctures induce new collagen growth, and elastin synthesis as the skin starts healing on its own. The micro-injuries created through Microneedling result in collagen production, scaffolding under the skin, which is responsible for improving the skin condition by reducing scars and wrinkles. Microneedling also creates tiny punctures or channels in the upper layer of the skin, making way for deeper serum penetration. This penetration of growth factors into the skin makes them more effective and results in skin betterment from the inside. Microneedling is a safe treatment procedure that uses your body’s natural response to help you get rid of stretch marks. It is suitable for all those who want to improve their stretch marks' appearance, though it is best to come in and see one of our specialists first. In case your skin is inflamed, infected, you start suffering from eczema or open acne lesions at the time of your treatment, we suggest you reschedule your appointment.</p>",Text-Image-Cards,Text,Paragraph
